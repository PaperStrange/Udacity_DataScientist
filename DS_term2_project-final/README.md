## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Before running this code, make sure by using Python versions 3.*, python packages including numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib and seaborn are installed properly.

Meanwhile, to use model [LightBGM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM), use pip to install it as follows.
```
pip install lightgbm
```

After above installation, the code should run with no issues.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I was interested in how to analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population as it is suggested by Udacity course. To help understand the motivation better, several questions are listed below:

* For Business Understanding
1. Before model is applied, how to design an online experiment to show its effectiveness?
2. If model is applied and operates normally, how to quantify and evaluate the net income from model?
3. After model operates for a long time, how to deal with the differences between the model predictions and reviews by customers?

* For Data Understanding
1. Does model is capable of dealing with big data?
2. Does model is capable of dealing with imbalanced data?
3. Does model is capable of dealing with small sample data?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions and correlated answers. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

No data are stored to obey the use rulers.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to kaggle for the data. Anyway, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
