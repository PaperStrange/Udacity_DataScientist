## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

<!--There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions which is exploratory in following procedures of `CRISP-DM process` to the questions showcased by this notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.-->

<!--Data are stored in "data" folder while some data files such as merchant data, transaction data are too large to upload. However all data are available for freely download in the competition page. Except for training and testing data stored respectively in "train" and "test" folder, a `.xlsx` file is provided for storing authority descriptions of all data files.-->

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().
