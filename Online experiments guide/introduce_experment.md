## Record: what do we need  to recognize an online successful experiment?

### Contents


## Terminology
First the declaration of experiment is stated below, origined from Wikipedia 
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment):

```
An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis.
```

 Obviously it is a powerful technique for making your business go up. WIth the faster and faster development of internet, online experiment overweights other formations because of its flexibility and its convenience for the further analysis. To step into online experiments, there are few necessary terms which shall be kept in mind. 

* Control group and experimental group:

* Types of study: experiment, observational study and quasi-experiment

<!-- * Experiment: in the social and medical sciences, an experiment is defined by comparing outcomes between two or more groups, and ensuring equivalence between the compared groups except for the manipulation that we want to test. Our interest in an experiment is to see if a change in one feature has an effect in the value of a second feature, like seeing if changing the layout of a button on a website causes more visitors to click on it. -->

<!-- * A unit of analysis: the entity under study, like a page view or a user in a web experiment. If we randomly assign our units of analysis to each group, then on the whole, we should expect the feature distributions between groups to be about the same. This theoretically isolates the changes in the outcome to the changes in our manipulated feature -->

<!-- * Factorial designs: manipulate the value of multiple features of interest. Factorial designs where multiple features are manipulated simultaneously are more frequently seen in engineering and physical sciences domains, where the system units tend to be under stricter control. They're less seen in the social and medical realms, where individual differences can impede experiment creation and analysis -->

* Types of experiment: between-subjects experiment (such as A/B test), within-subjects experiment

* Type of sampling: simple random sampling, stratified random sampling and non-probabilistic sampling

* User funnel:

* Metrics

* Non-parametric tests
don't rely on many assumptions of the underlying population, and so can be used in a wider range of circumstances compared to standard tests
